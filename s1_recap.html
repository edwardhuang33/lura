		<p style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">North Siofera, during the Reign of Aman VII</p>
		<p> In the small town of Nalda, surrounded by barren deserts, a ragtag group of travellers were hired to intercept a package. On the journey to the Midnight Forest, many hijinks ensued, including starting a revolution, uncovering a conspiracy against the Althilian king, and discovering a device that lets them explore memories of the past. Enemies were made, alliances were forged (and lost). When at last they reached the Brazen Bridge, the group quickly discovered that the supposed package was, in fact, a high-profile prisoner, and they were promptly framed for his escape. Now in hiding within the Golden City of Althil, the group must work with an underground network to expose the conspiracy and clear their names – or else find some other means to escape their impending death… </p>
