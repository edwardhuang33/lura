            Warm rays bathed the room in amber light, glimmering specks of dust dancing in the shafts of honeyed luminescence. A soft breeze shimmered through the translucent drapes across the windows, causing faint ripples of light to shimmer against the oaken panels along the walls.

            Crickets chirped outside as she entered the room. She placed the tray, laiden with a palette of dried petals and herbs, on a small table beside the bed. The patient lay motionless, eyes closed. Meticulously, as so many times before, she began grinding and mixing, the array of pastel powders coalescing into a pale grey dust. From a small ceramic jug she splashed a clear liquid into the bowl, and set the mixture above a small flame.

            Footsteps from down the corridor betrayed his entrance.
        </p><p>
            "I hear you went away again." There was a soft creak in the floorboards as he leaned against the doorframe.
        </p><p>
            His soft tone did not bely anger, but she nevertheless paused before speaking, choosing her words carefully.
        </p><p>
            "I did. The lands remain weak, but as ever, life persists." She wrung a small cloth that had been floating in a bowl of cool water, and gently wiped the sleeping face.
        </p><p>
            By the door, he remained silent for a while, watching.
        </p><p>
            "How is he?"
        </p><p>
            "The same. As ever."
        </p><p>
            Arms behind his back, he paced over to the window, gazing out over the valley and its sparse, beige flora.
        </p><p>
            It was a while before he spoke again. "You know well it is not for me to tell you what to do. But I trust that you remain careful. We must remember that tampering with the natural course can have... unintended results."
        </p><p>
            She did not avert her gaze towards the window where he stood, focusing on the figure on the bed. She rested two fingers on his wrist. <em>Steady,</em> she noted. <em>As ever.</em>
        </p><p>
            He was right, though. "I will be careful. I know you prefer us to remain here, but the storm rises again. They are weak. Weaker than ever before. And they must be ready."
        </p><p>
            He continued staring out the window. Beyond the mountains that basked in the last rays of golden light, the rumbles of chaos echoed amongst the stones. This time, it was she that was right. 
            <em>The storm is coming, indeed,</em> he thought. <em>Only this time, what have we to stop it?</em>
        </p><p>
            Over the snowy peaks, the skies began to murmur their first cries of rage once more. 
        </p>
