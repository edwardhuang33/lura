		<p> Bazaran and Ramon stood alone in the courtyard, as pallid specks of burning debris fell on the overgrown grass, matted with blood. Around them lay the casualties of the long fight: Tawa and 
            Buzze, blotched red faces swollen from the venom-tipped arrows; Uda, skull cracked from the final blow of his deceived comrade; Izonal, face down in a pool of his own blood; Zari, pallid face 
            staring lifelessly at the uncaring blue sky above. On the rooftop lay her vanquisher, a smile still frozen on Lewis' face even as he was thrown backwards by the force of Zendurun's shot. 
            The crazed merchant himself lay slumped over amongst the sandbags, blood running from his slit throat amongst the tiles down to the ground far below.</p>
 
    <p>There was silence, save for the gentle crackles of burning rubble, and distant caws of sandhawks across the desert expanse beyond the Palace walls. At last, Ramon spoke.</p>
    
    <p>"I would like to revise the terms of our deal, Bazaran."</p>
    
    <p>The next day, Bazaran appeared before the Althilian masses, attended by the landed elite of Sioferan society. Hidden away in the Palaace, Ramon stood in courtyard, waiting for the 
        fanfare to begin. Then, he shut his eyes and gently placed his hand against the Phantom Rose that was nestled within the column, whose exterior - studded with Aether diamonds - 
        sparkled in the sunlight. Pale wisps of light emerged from the column and spiralled towards the sky, pure Brea leaping from the construct and arching gracefully towards their destination.</p>
    
    <p>And so the Althilian Plot was complete. With the full power of the construct behind him, Bazaran activated his amulet AÃ®zor and deceived the masses into seeing not the maimed Highborn 
        that stood before them, but Prince Ossai himself. As he knelt to receive the Golden Crown of Althil, his revenge against the true Prince, for killing his lover and horrifically injuring 
        him so long ago, was at last complete. As he sat on the marble throne, for the first time since that night in the burning house, Bazaran smiled.</p>
    
    <p> In the years that followed, King Ossai II and his second-in-command, Lord Chancellor Ramon Q. Silver, would pursue an aggressive expansionist policy that reestablished Althilian dominance 
        over Northern Siofera, ushering forth the Fifth Althilian Empire. Ramon ruthlessly dispatched any who sought to oppose him: former Lord Commander Oren Marelius was personally shot by Ramon 
        after his loyalist forces were defeated at the battle of Grato's Watch, and following a bloody war against the rebelling Glades, Ramon oversaw the execution of Johna and Gallian Nowis, 
        Mayors of Brighstville and leaders of the resistance.</p>
    
    <p>Ramon proved to be a shrewd and unrelenting strategist. He forged deals with critical members of the elite to ensure his political dominance, and struck deals to ensure Althil's new territories, 
        which stretched from Sunur to Hima, would persist into the new age. He quickly removed any threats to the stability of Bazaran's reign from the picture, including replacing new Inspector-General 
        Levea Caralis when she stumbled too close to the truth of Bazaran's deception, as well as exiling Tamara and Sira Marelius (Oren's wife and daughter) to ensure they never came too close to the truth. 
        He sought to purge corruption from the Imperial ranks, and quash any disloyalty, whilst pursuing trade and wealth creation. Boistered with new-found prosperity, Althil began to expand beyond 
        the city walls which had marked its boundaries for centuries, and the reclamation of the ruins of Greater Althil began.</p>
    
    <p style = "text-align: center;">***</p>
    
    <p>At just 19 hours, Lewis Cannen became the shortest-serving Inspector-General of the Althilian Police in its history. But with the discovery of his notes and the confessions of his predecessor,
        Karis Harlac, his story spread far and wide. Cadets and crewmen from cities across the continent came to know of the unwavering conviction of a single detective, who gave his pride, his job, and
        ultimately even his life in the duty of justice. Although the exact circumstances around his death were never confirmed - many believed he managed to stop the Cannen Killer,
        as no further killings with ties to the previous cases were ever discovered - his story became Police legend.</p>

    <p>Many years later, a young woman would walk into the Althil Police station, now a bustling community centre responsible for the wellbeing of the prospering city and the great rebuild of the Spit.
        This woman, who identified herself as Milla Harlac, recounted the story of how a grizzled police officer had saved her and her mother's life by organising their flight from the city when they 
        were being unjustly hunted. She herself would commit her life to the improvement of Althil, and at her inaugaration as Mayor of Althil dedicated her speech to the memory of her father, who 
        gave his life during the attacks on the city, and his closest confidante, who gave his life hunting down those responsible. 
    </p>

    <p>The marble bust of Lewis Cannen's head joined others commemorated by the Golden Cross, staring across Tiergith's Square - and across the city to which he gave everything - for many decades to come.</p>

    <p style = "text-align: center;">***</p>
    
    <p>When Tawa Hamlutts' body was returned to the Church of the Fifth Redemption, there was much mourning at the loss of one of their most beloved figureheads. The funeral of the Red Tower Ranger
        was attended by many influential figures within the religious, multi-level marketing, and slam poetry communities. Even Oli Tom, the estranged Green Tower Ranger who Tawa had fabricated as an 
        arch-nemesis and so had spent the last year on the run, came to pay his respects.
    </p>

    <p>That night, the rest of the Tower Rangers sat on the roof drinking bottled fruit juice. Though Tawa had been absent from their group for several weeks, away on his important secret mission, 
        they vowed to continue fighting in his name. The Tower Rangers would continue on the quest to rid the world of crime for at least ten more seasons before they were rebooted, an archaeic Fifth Redemption 
        ritual where one of their operations files for bankruptcy and their assets are liquidated for other uses.
    </p>

    <p>One of the glass bottles Kymbli threw off the roof landed next to a horse that was riding along the street below, startling it and causing it to suddenly throw its owner to the ground. 
        The mare's rider happened to be a local crime boss on his way to deliver a rallying speech that would incense his underlings to ignite a bloodthirsty gang war that would shake Althil to its core.
        Unfortunately for him, he hit his head hard on the pavement as he was thrown off his horse and contracted a severe case of amnesia. Unsure of his mission, he dedicated the rest of his life to
        a local bakery that specialised in deep-fried toast.
    </p>

    <p style = "text-align: center;">***</p>
    
    <p>Mortar awoke face down on the pavement, steaming horse dung to his left and mouldy haybales to his right. On all fours he dragged himself along the floor, grunting in agony as his head and heart 
        pounded relentlessly. He learnt that Elisha had found him running back to Mercenary Avenue, covered in Ire and blood and a glowing blue liquid, swinging wildly at anyone near him. His pulse had been 
        an erratic frenzy, like the patter of grain pouring into a mill. Suspecting he had done something very dangerous and needing herself to move out of the city as soon as possible, she had 
        thrown him into her cart and rode out the city as fast as she could.</p>
    
    <p>It took Mortar weeks to recover from the damage he sustained from the Ire and Ueia, and for much longer afterwards he would awaken in the middle of the nights screaming from torturous hallucinations.  
        The small group of mercenaries made their way southwards, hearing news of the coronation of the King and his new moves to reassert Althilian dominance in the north. Mortar knew something was wrong, 
        but with the rest of the group dead - or an enemy - and his frequent nightmares of Althil preventing him from even considering a return, he decided some stones were best left unturned.</p>
    
    <p>The group settled in Thoronar, where the streets buzzed with activity, violence and gang wars were rife, and the Arzurda River ran red with blood - a perfect place for mercenaries to find work. 
        Mortar made his living for a while, learning in the meantime of the Golden City's conquests. He considered returning for revenge on Ramon Q. Silver, hearing that he now served as second-in-command 
        to the King himself. One summer, however, Anna Kerson - now mayor of the prospering town of Nalda - came to visit Elisha, and warned Mortar against ever returning to Northern Siofera. "If they 
        find you in Althilian territory, you will be dead before the next daybreak," she warns, recounting how she lost one of her closest friends after prying into places she shouldn't have been. Mortar 
        decided that perhaps it was best to close that chapter of his life for now, but swore that should he ever see Ramon in person again, he would not hesitate to enact his vengeance. </p>
    
    <p>After a skirmish with the senior mercenaries the group had been working for, Elisha suggested the group split off and start their own company. The mercenary group quickly established its name, 
        winning high-profile clients with efficient technique and spotless record. Though their fame also brought rivals, some with a serious intent to remove the group from the picture permanently, the 
        group fended them off and established themselves as the most prestigious mercenary operation in all of Thoronar. And so began the story of the Renegades.</p>
    
    <p>Several years later, Elisha's parents and husband were brutally killed in a revenge attack against one of the clients she worked for. She pulled Mortar aside to speak in private, and decided she was 
        going to step away from the mercenary life, resigning her position as de facto leader, and offered him the role as her replacement. Mortar spent a long time deliberating. Perhaps from the tragic end to 
        his closest friend's family, or perhaps from the memory of the demise of his previous companions, deep-seated doubts bubbled up on his ability to protect those he had responsibility over.
        But with some convincing from his colleagues and friends, he took the role.</p>

    <p>Mortar would take the Renegades from the most respected mercenary group in Thoronar to something else entirely. In the long fight ahead, the Renegades became responsible
        for the protection of hundreds of wealthy elite, and later even ensuring the survival of the last bastions of entire states - all, of course, for a price. The wealth and fame brought with it
        the opportunity for continued expansion, until the Renegades were almost an entire military of its own. Organisation became paramount, and with the help of shrewd advisors Mortar evolved
        the Renegades beyond just a group of fighters. The headquarters became a sanctuary, the mercenaries became a community, the work became a mission. Ultimately, during a particularly vicious ambush, 
        Mortar would give his life for his organisation, holding back the oncoming attackers whilst the rest of his crew made their escape. Almost three centuries later, when Mortar was long passed, his 
        legacy persisted, and the Renegades continued to evolve. In honour of their founders, of the leaders who had the vision and the drive to create a collective that became so much more, the first Signers
        chose a name to remember their origins. 
    </p>

    <p>And so the nation of Elimor was born.</p>
    
    <p style = "text-align: center;">***</p>
    
    <p>Uda Rosa Ell lived a hard life. 25 years in servitude of an unloving family, gazing helplessly as they lived their destructive exhorbitant lifestyle, and another 5 years on the run, before being 
        caught up in a plot quickly spiralled far out of his control. He had spent most his life trying desperately to avoid the vicious bloodlust that had plagued him since he was but a young child. But as he sat
        in that dusty room, far away from the lands he called home, he felt sunlight gently drift through the window and come to rest on his face, and a quiet calm finally settled through his troubled mind. 
    </p>
    
    <p>The young girl who introduced herself as Evangelina sat down beside him, and silently rested a hand on his shoulder. Her eyes seemed to swirl a restless amber as she started at him. In a voice that rang 
        like the soft peal of Aeden morning bells, she told Uda of the story of Lura, the prophecy that had been sung long ago, and the fight still to come. She told him of how his sacrifice would set in motion
        a chain of events that may prove to be Lura's final hope in its time of great need. <i>"When the Duet is sung, the choice shall be given."</i>  
    </p>

    <p>Uda smiled as the light grew brighter through the window, and he felt peace.</p>

    <p style = "text-align: center;">***</p>
    
    <p>Buzze Horndim died as he lived: angry, confused, covered in blood, and with a distinct lack of bees.</p>

    <p>At least he had a cool metal arm now.</p>

    <p style = "text-align: center;">***</p>
    
    <p>Several years into Ossai's reign, Althil's dominant position in Northern Siofera was at last secured. With its power came increased trade, better security, technological progress. Ramon worked 
        tirelessly, pouring all his focus into Althil's operations. Though he found satisfaction in seeing the difference he made, and possessed as many material comforts as he could ask for, deep 
        down he knew that part of the reason he had thrown every waking hour into his duties was to distract himself from the heavy losses he had sustained getting there. With the loss of his entire family, 
        there was a part of him that was gone forever, lost amidst raging storms and vicious bloodshed. His nights were filled with restless sleep and torturous dreams, of regret that he could not save his 
        parents, nor his sister.</p>
    
    <p>However, 10 years after Zari's death and the dawn of the new Age of Althil, the skies and the seas began to boil. Crops were devastated, trade routes rendered untraversable by the tumultuous waters 
        which are warm to the touch. Refugees from across Siofera flocked to Althil, seeking shelter from the disastrous climate. Riots erupted and violence spiked as food grew scarce and water supplies 
        were spread thin. A year later, the Yrqkun invaded as Lura shattered into pieces, the monstrous insectoid invaders spilling out of rifts in the ground, ruthlessly killing any that opposed them. 
        Ramon mobilised the Althilian troops to erect defences against these horrifying creatures, smartly using the desperation of surrounding regions to sign treaties that allowed Althil to consolidate 
        its power in the region - should the city survive the oncoming onslaught.</p>
    
    <p>The fight was long, the blood ran thick amidst the fields, the sands, and the cobblestones. Althil's forces were stretched thin by the heavy war of attrition, but Althil remained standing as a 
        bastion of resistance against the invading Underworld. Things were dire, however, and Ramon saw his dreams of a new Althil slipping from his grasp as the city burned under siege. Bazaran was 
        invited to an audience of a grand coalition across the three continents of Trien, and Ramon joined him as he traveled to Altamion. The situation seemed dire - even the most well-fortified and 
        wealthiest strongholds were beginning to stumble against the relentless Yrkqun forces. Ramon learned of a last-ditch attempt, a desperate throw of the dice - an ancient myth that fortold a hero 
        that should rise up at each time when Lura falters on the edge of total destructions. The Altemerian Emperor believed he had found this individual, and she had been set off on this last journey. 
        Most of the attendees scoffed at the very thought of resting the entire fate of Lura on some old wives' tale - and the ridicule grew more incredulous when they learned that the kingdoms in Tabrea 
        across the Great Sea also claimed to have found the savior - but as Ramon walked through the City of Stars he encountered Hira, with a young daughter sitting beside her. She reminded him that he 
        himself was no stranger to visions of the paths ahead, and that many of the events he saw when he first met her had come true. Whilst she did not confirm the legend was accurate, she indicated that 
        this was not the first time Lura had hung in the balance of just a few individuals' decisions and actions. When the Choice is given, she said, only they shall decide whether Lura survives, or falls.</p>
    
    <p>Before his return to Siofera, Ramon asked leave to visit Emsen on the east cost of Eresoa. There, he visited Brandon Novaq, now a senile man confined to his home by his own age. Ramon told him the 
        story of Zari's life after she left his house, how she remained grateful for everything Brandon had done, and ultimately the story of her death. Brandon told Ramon that he thought both Zari and his parents 
        would be proud of all he had done, and the fights he had fought in these tumultuous times. Finally, he revealed that when his sister first came into his care, he was asked to change her name so 
        as to protect her identity. Her real name was Qari Silver, after the ancient legends of Qariah, an unlikely daughter of the celestial Evangelina, who was shunned by the other celestials but stood 
        amongst the stars, guiding those who were lost and abandoned back to their true homes. As he stared at Ramon with a warm smile, the aging Lord Chancellor remembered once asking his parents what the 
        Q in his name stood for, and they simply had said that they hoped one day he could discover for himself.</p>
    
    <p>On Ramon's journey back through Eresoa, showers of starfalls illuminated the skies almost every night. </p>
    
    <p>Retuning to Althil, Ramon and the City's forces continued the long fight. 19 years after the battle in the Courtyard, the Yrkqun forces fall, and made their retreat back to whence they came. 
        Ramon heard stories of a great journey to the Tether Between Worlds in the mists of the Great Sea, but the stories came in so many varieties and with so much hyperbole he doubted he would ever 
        learn the full truth. As the siege of Althil was lifted at last, Ramon moved quickly to make good on the treaties that had been signed when the Invasion was still in its early stages, and establishd 
        a new empire for the Althilian Republic.</p>
    
    <p>Bazaran, meanwhile, had become old and weary. He confided in Ramon that his strength was waning, and he believed his goals were achieved: he fulfilled his vengeance against the family that had 
        murdered his lover and maimed him for life, and had seen to Althil's rise to dominance. He announced that he would not stand for re-election for the upcoming period. The campaigns and 
        the politicking began. A couple of families offered Ramon untold riches and a continued position of highest influence if he joined them. A close confidante even revealed that it was possible under the 
        Charter for the Lord Chancellor himself to run if the King stood down, suggesting there may even have been significant support if Ramon decided to stand for election - by no means a guaranteed win, 
        but the opportunity was there. However, after nearly twenty years of service, including several fights to the death and a decade-long apocalyptic battle, Ramon was exhausted. The seemingly 
        celestial events of recent years had changed his mind about the power of politics, or one statesman, to determine the course of history. With powers in the cosmos clearly beyond his understanding, 
        his conviction that he alone could restore Althil to its former place was ebbing away, and his encounters with Brandon and Hira had turned his thoughts to the past, and to home. Calling on his 
        final favours within the Golden City, Ramon successfully ensured the victory of his protegee, and Tamira I became the second Queen of the Althilian Republic.</p>
    
    <p>His job finally complete, Ramon retired to Cranetown, purchasing a house where Robert and Mary Silver once lived, and expanded the estate into a grand townhouse. On either side of crimson 
        Princewood doors stood a statue of a fox. They stared out across the bay towards Emsen and the Great Sea, which - for the first time in centuries - remained calm and clear beneath the 
        crystal blue sky.</p>
