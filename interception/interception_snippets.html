            Warm rays bathed the room in amber light, glimmering specks of dust dancing in the shafts of honeyed luminescence. A soft breeze shimmered through the translucent drapes across the windows, causing faint ripples of light to shimmer against the oaken panels along the walls.
        </p><p>
            Crickets chirped outside as she entered the room. She placed the tray, laiden with a palette of dried petals and herbs, on a small table beside the bed. The patient lay motionless, eyes closed. Meticulously, as so many times before, she began grinding and mixing, the array of pastel powders coalescing into a pale grey dust. From a small ceramic jug she splashed a clear liquid into the bowl, and set the mixture above a small flame.
        </p><p>
            Footsteps from down the corridor betrayed his entrance.
        </p><p>
            "I hear you went away again." There was a soft creak in the floorboards as he leaned against the doorframe.
        </p><p>
            His soft tone did not bely anger, but she nevertheless paused before speaking, choosing her words carefully.
        </p><p>
            "I did. The lands remain weak, but as ever, life persists." She wrung a small cloth that had been floating in a bowl of cool water, and gently wiped the sleeping face.
        </p><p>
            By the door, he remained silent for a while, watching.
        </p><p>
            "How is he?"
        </p><p>
            "The same. As ever."
        </p><p>
            Arms behind his back, he paced over to the window, gazing out over the valley and its sparse, beige flora.
        </p><p>
            It was a while before he spoke again. "You know well it is not for me to tell you what to do. But I trust that you remain careful. We must remember that tampering with the natural course can have... unintended results."
        </p><p>
            She did not avert her gaze towards the window where he stood, focusing on the figure on the bed. She rested two fingers on his wrist. <em>Steady,</em> she noted. <em>As ever.</em>
        </p><p>
            He was right, though. "I will be careful. I know you prefer us to remain here, but the storm rises again. They are weak. Weaker than ever before. And they must be ready."
        </p><p>
            He continued staring out the window. Beyond the mountains that basked in the last rays of golden light, the rumbles of chaos echoed amongst the stones. This time, it was she that was right. 
            <em>The storm is coming, indeed,</em> he thought. <em>Only this time, what have we to stop it?</em>
        </p><p>
            Over the snowy peaks, the skies began to murmur their first cries of rage once more. 
        </p>

        <h1 style = "text-align:center">II. The Return</h1>
		<p style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">Althil</p>
		<p>
            Rough-hewn cobbled walls surrounded the garden, reducing the cacophonic chorus of the city beyond to a low murmur. Amongst the scattering of petals and tamed grass, 
            concentric rings of small pebbles, carefully arranged into uniform shape and colour, studded the ground. At the epicentre, he sat cross-legged, eyes shut.
        </p><p>
            He did not stir as she approached, unceremoniously dropping a small leather satchel onto the ground. It thudded impassively as it hit the hardened dirt.
        </p><p>
            "This may be the last batch for a while. We've bled the whole city dry."
        </p><p>
            His eyes remained closed. "Thank you. Your efforts are appreciated."
        </p><p>
            Her eyes narroweed indignantly. "<em>Appreciated?</em> Do you know how much trouble it is to get these without raising suspicion? 
            The merchants are beginning to take notice. These things don't exactly sprout out of the ground."
        </p><p>
            This time his eyes did open, one eyebrow raised as he studied her carefully. She continued glaring at him, but after a moment her resolve gave way and she turned aside,
            clenching her jaw. She gave the bag a frustrated kick.
        </p><p>
            "Something is troubling you, child."
        </p><p>
            "No shit."
        </p><p>
            "We are close to victory. This is no time to be anxious."
        </p><p>
            "Oh isn't it?" she snapped. "Well it's a little hard to be calm when things are moving beyond our control." Frustrated, she paced over to shade under a withering redoak, whose thin crimson 
            branches leant across a small stream that trickled underneath. The clear water burbled and eddied in a pebbled trough, glittering like coarse glass under the unrelenting 
            midday sun.
        </p><p>
            "We're close, but on the edge of the whole thing being torn wide open. We need to find these people, figure out how they know about us, and stop them. 
            How the hell did they find out?"
        </p><p>
            She could almost hear his gentle smile behind her. <em>Infuriating.</em> 
        </p><p>
            "Be at peace, child. We shall find them soon enough. They will slip up, and we will make sure they are a problem no longer."
            With her back turned, the momentary twitch as her brow furrowed and concern swept across her face, was hidden from view. "I'm sure learning their secrets won't be difficult
            once we have them."
        </p><p>
            "Not if I can't find any more of these." She kicked the bag again. "Then it'll be our secrets we have to worry about."
        </p><p>
            "Fret not. The Grand Chancellor is arriving later today. I suspect it will not be difficult to make a deal that works to our benefit. SÃ»nur's coffers are rich for the taking."
        </p><p>
            "You know he's insane."
        </p><p>
            "Most powerful men are."
        </p><p>
            Amongst the trees, distant shouts grew louder. Her hand instinctively moved to the dagger on hip as she moved backwards towards the pebbled rings, 
            alert eyes darting amongst the manicured flora.
        </p><p>
            A figure burst from amongst the hedges and collapsed to the ground, panting heavily. His pursuers emerged just seconds later, swords drawn.
        </p><p>
            "Sorry sir. He must have climbed in over the wall."
        </p><p>
            She stared at the figure's dirty rags, stained brown with filth and dried blood. The figure lifted his head, and pulled himself up into a kneeling bow. She took long strides
            towards him as she unsheathed her dagger.
        </p><p>
            "What the hell are you doing here?" she hissed.
        </p><p>
            His voice was a parched growl. 
        </p><p>
            "Oren. He's alive."
        </p>
